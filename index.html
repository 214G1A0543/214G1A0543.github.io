                <p>Off-campus, you'll often find me on the court, smashing it out in games like Throwball and Tennekoit. And when I'm not sweating it out, I'm likely whipping up something delicious in the kitchenâ€”I'm a bit of a foodie!</p>
                <p>I'm always up for a challenge and eager to team up with fellow enthusiasts to shape the future of tech.</p>
